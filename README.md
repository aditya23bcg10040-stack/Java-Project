Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM)

This is the Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM)
This is a console-based Java SE application designed to help educational institutes manage students , courses , enrollments, grades, and backups efficiently

Project Overview

CCRM allows the institute to:

Manage Students: Add, update, list, and deactivate students; enroll/unenroll them in courses.

Manage Courses: Add, update, list, search courses; assign instructors; filter by semester, department, or instructor.

Handle Grades & Transcripts: Record marks, compute GPA, and print transcripts using polymorphism and enums.

File Operations: Import/export CSV-like files, backup data to timestamped folders, and recursively analyze file sizes.

CLI Workflow: A simple menu-driven console interface for all operations, demonstrating Java loops, switch, and decision constructs.

The application is built using core Java features like OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism), Streams, Lambdas, Enums, NIO.2, Date/Time API, nested classes, design patterns (Singleton & Builder), recursion, and robust exception handling.
